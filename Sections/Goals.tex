	The goal of this work is to develop a new state-of-the-art thermodynamic equilibrium code for direct integration in mutiphysics framework MOOSE.
	\end{block}}
	\onslide<2->{\begin{exampleblock}{Outcomes} \footnotesize
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Development of a new advanced Gibbs energy minimiser written in C++ within the framework of MOOSE platform.
		\item Full integration within the multiphysics framework MOOSE, with the intent of coupling to the phase field code Marmot. 
		\item Enhanced initialisation algorithms to improve the computational performance.
		\item Investigation and implementation of robust global optimisation schemes to increase reliability and robustness.
		\item Software Quality Assurance  with rigorous verification and testing to comply with the NQA-1 guidelines required to be met for licensing.
