		\begin{itemize}
			\item<1-> Experiments can not predict the material properties at every single point in the life of a nuclear material.
			\item<2-> Multiphysics simulations have to rely on empirical correlations of material properties.
			\item<3-> This reduces the accuracy of simulation.
			\item<4-> Thermochemistry allows us to capture the effect of compositional evolution on the properties of materials.
			\item<5-> Investigate phenomena which would be impossible to study using only experiments.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item<+-> Direct coupling of thermochemical equilibrium calculations has only recently gained traction in the scientific community.
		\item<+-> Equilibrium calculations are extremely costly compared to other finite element based simulations.
		\item<+-> The material science community has traditionally relied on using phase diagrams and relatively simple material models in order to save computational cost.
		\item<+-> Most thermodynamic equilibrium softwares, such as ThermoCalc and FactSage, are commercial, standalone codes developed in 1990s.
		\item<+-> There is little freedom to make improvements or adapt them to specific needs.
		\item<+->	Thermochimica is an open-source code developed with the aim of direct coupling with multiphysics codes.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Written in Fortran 90.
				\item Not developed within the MOOSE framework.
				\item Needs significant work to meet the NQA-1 standards.
